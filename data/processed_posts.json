This belief reflects my optimism for AI as a transformative tool in medicine. However, this study shared by Allie K. Miller paints a different, eye-opening and somehow concerning picture. According to JAMA Network Open, ChatGPT alone achieved a remarkable 90% diagnostic accuracy. Surprisingly, doctors using ChatGPT for assistance only scored 76%\u2014barely better than those without AI support (74%). Why is this happening? Two challenges stand out: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Overconfidence: Doctors sometimes ignored ChatGPT\u2019s correct diagnoses if they conflicted with their own reasoning. This highlights the need for AI to better explain the 'why' behind its recommendations, fostering trust without manipulation. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Underuse: Many doctors treat AI as a glorified Google search. Instead of fully engaging with the data\u2014e.g., inputting detailed patient histories and analyzing responses\u2014they miss the true potential of tools like ChatGPT.",

        "text": "AI in 2024: A Leadership Opportunity, Not Just a Technology Shift. AI is no longer just transforming industries\u2014it\u2019s reshaping what it means to lead effectively. As a leadership coach, I see this as a critical moment for leaders to step up and embrace AI strategically. If we fail to lead with purpose in this era, we risk falling behind. Here are four principles I believe every leader should consider: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Generative AI: It\u2019s About Value, Not Just Tools Generative AI is changing the game across industries, but tools alone won\u2019t drive impact. Leaders must ask: How does AI align with our strategy? How can it amplify human potential? The best leaders ensure AI innovation delivers tangible business value and empowers their teams. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Focus on People, Not Just Systems AI doesn\u2019t replace people\u2014it enhances their potential. Organizations thriving with AI are those investing in upskilling their teams and fostering cross-functional collaboration. As I often remind leaders: Your team\u2019s ability to adapt to AI reflects your ability to lead with vision and empathy. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Ethical Leadership in AI With great power comes great responsibility. AI demands leaders address challenges like bias, ethical concerns, and security risks. Governance frameworks are essential for building trust and ensuring AI initiatives create sustainable, positive impact. 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Leadership as Strategy Architect The divide between AI leaders and laggards is growing. The most effective leaders are embedding AI into their core strategies\u2014not treating it as a one-off initiative. Are you driving transformation or just reacting to trends?",

Why are you not putting in the effort?\u201d But then, if you see their physical health and diet, you will just know why. It is very expensive to have a nutritious meal, twice or thrice a day.

Most people in rural India are far from being healthy enough to learn new skills and use mental cognitive abilities at reasonable capacity. To have chemicals that strengthen our logical, analytical reasoning ability, to memorise stuff, our brain needs nutrition. Education system or skill India jese initiatives kya kar lenge jab insaan ka shareer aur dimag hi kamzor hai? Right now we are only producing labour that is not upskill-able.
