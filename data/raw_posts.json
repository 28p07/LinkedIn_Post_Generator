It hurt deeply. But now, when things don’t go as planned, I don’t panic.\n\nI don’t question my worth. I sit back, breathe, and trust. The Universe knows.\n\nI know there's another plan waiting.

It’s easy to get caught up in the 'big company = big talent' mindset, but that's not always the case.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of working with people from smaller companies (lesser known) who blow me away with their skills and dedication. They don’t need a fancy title or a famous brand behind them to prove their worth.\n\nI've seen the other side too—people in top-tier companies feeling lost, overwhelmed, or stuck, even though the world sees them as 'successful'.\n\nLet’s stop attaching someone’s value to the company they work for. Freshers especially need to hear this—skills are what matter, not the size of the company behind them.\n\nAt the end of the day, happiness and growth don’t come from a brand name, they come from doing what you love and constantly improving your craft."

WTFund is India’s premier non-dilutive grant fund for emerging entrepreneurs under 25. Through the first WTFund Cohort (C1/24), 9 startups with 15 young founders under the age of 25, were shortlisted and these are some of the coolest ones we discovered.. The second cohort applications are now open and if you are a young entrepreneur under or at the age of 25, you should apply."

        "text": "When I speak about AI, I often say that doctors leveraging AI are more effective than AI alone—and far more effective than doctors not using AI at all. This belief reflects my optimism for AI as a transformative tool in medicine. However, this study shared by Allie K. Miller paints a different, eye-opening and somehow concerning picture. According to JAMA Network Open, ChatGPT alone achieved a remarkable 90% diagnostic accuracy. Surprisingly, doctors using ChatGPT for assistance only scored 76%—barely better than those without AI support (74%). Why is this happening? Two challenges stand out: 1️⃣ Overconfidence: Doctors sometimes ignored ChatGPT’s correct diagnoses if they conflicted with their own reasoning. This highlights the need for AI to better explain the 'why' behind its recommendations, fostering trust without manipulation. 2️⃣ Underuse: Many doctors treat AI as a glorified Google search. Instead of fully engaging with the data—e.g., inputting detailed patient histories and analyzing responses—they miss the true potential of tools like ChatGPT."

        "text": "AI in 2024: A Leadership Opportunity, Not Just a Technology Shift. AI is no longer just transforming industries—it’s reshaping what it means to lead effectively. As a leadership coach, I see this as a critical moment for leaders to step up and embrace AI strategically. If we fail to lead with purpose in this era, we risk falling behind. Here are four principles I believe every leader should consider: 1️⃣ Generative AI: It’s About Value, Not Just Tools Generative AI is changing the game across industries, but tools alone won’t drive impact. Leaders must ask: How does AI align with our strategy? How can it amplify human potential? The best leaders ensure AI innovation delivers tangible business value and empowers their teams. 2️⃣ Focus on People, Not Just Systems AI doesn’t replace people—it enhances their potential. Organizations thriving with AI are those investing in upskilling their teams and fostering cross-functional collaboration. As I often remind leaders: Your team’s ability to adapt to AI reflects your ability to lead with vision and empathy. 3️⃣ Ethical Leadership in AI With great power comes great responsibility. AI demands leaders address challenges like bias, ethical concerns, and security risks. Governance frameworks are essential for building trust and ensuring AI initiatives create sustainable, positive impact. 4️⃣ Leadership as Strategy Architect The divide between AI leaders and laggards is growing. The most effective leaders are embedding AI into their core strategies—not treating it as a one-off initiative. Are you driving transformation or just reacting to trends?"

        "text": "We cannot have skilled work force if we do not solve this problem! Sometimes, I get a little agitated when young boys and girls we work with in villages take 3-4 attempts to learn simple things. “Why can’t you understand something so simple? Why are you not putting in the effort?” But then, if you see their physical health and diet, you will just know why. It is very expensive to have a nutritious meal, twice or thrice a day. In cities, we are aware abt vitamin, protein & mineral deficiencies and we can supplement it. We feel tired, doc tells us B12 could help. We feel constantly sad and body pains, a doctor tells us Vit D could help. But this is so unheard of for most Indians. Most people in rural India are far from being healthy enough to learn new skills and use mental cognitive abilities at reasonable capacity. To have chemicals that strengthen our logical, analytical reasoning ability, to memorise stuff, our brain needs nutrition. Education system or skill India jese initiatives kya kar lenge jab insaan ka shareer aur dimag hi kamzor hai? Right now we are only producing labour that is not upskill-able. Zeal, joy, confidence, willingness to work hard - these are all chemical & hormonal triggers. We need food that keeps hormones in check. It is sooo painful to see what kids get at so many mid day schools. Itne weak hai ye bachhe physically bhi its unreasonable to expect them to learn well or get medals for us at Olympics. We really need to solve this. Nutrition that is affordable and accessible for Bharat🙏 If govt could do it, they would have. So much leakage in between. Pata nahi kese chote bachho ke hakk ka khana churane walo ke gale se khana utarta hai."

        "text": "100% agreed to this - in my experience, working with a full-time team of 80+, optimal working hours is 5 hours. Even I can’t work productively for more than 6-7 hours a day, rest of the time it’s only doing mundane work or as we call it in office ‘executive time pass’. Whenever team members work for more than normal hours, I just know something is not right in their personal life & they are just overworking to distract themselves. That’s not sustainable. I’m lucky to work in a place where, if my mood tanks or anxiety kicks in, my boss doesn’t just give me a pep talk – they hand me a punching bag or a sleeping bed to smash or snooze it out! And when that’s done, they even order food to refuel the soul. Now that’s how you handle bad vibes – with punches, naps, and snacks!"
